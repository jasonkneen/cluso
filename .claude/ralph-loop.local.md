add files and source code buttons to the top toolbar when connected to a project, allowing the display of a file tree in the left hand panel -- use an existing high rated file viewer component from kibo-ui or shadcn or npm etc) and then when a file is selected we can open the file with a nice editor that is themeable and can edit the source code there and switch betweeen that and preview etc). It should allow us to also use this for sourcemapping so we can jump to the code if we want to from selecting something in the preview
